Hello,

{{ event_attending.name }} has answered '{{ event_attending.choice }}' to your event {{ event.title }}.

You can find your event here: {{ url_scheme }}://{{ base_url }}/{{ event.slug }}
And it's administration page here: {{ url_scheme }}://{{ base_url }}/event_admin/{{ event.admin_id }}

You can uncheck "send me emails for answers and comments on the event" (or remove your email) on the event administration page to avoid receiving more emails like this.

Cheers,
