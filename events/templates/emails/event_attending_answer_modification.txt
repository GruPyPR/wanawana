Hello,

The user {{ event_attending.name }} has made the following modifications in his/her answer:
{% for modification in modifications %}* {{ modification }}
{% endfor %}

You can find your event here: {{ url_scheme }}://{{ base_url }}/{{ event.slug }}
And it's administration page here: {{ url_scheme }}://{{ base_url }}/event_admin/{{ event.admin_id }}

You can uncheck "send me emails for answers and comments on the event" (or remove your email) on the event administration page to avoid receiving more emails like this.

Cheers,
